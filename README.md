## sniffing-and-spoofing-lab
This repository contains my solutions to SEED Lab sniffing and spoofing exercises.

<br>

#### Capture only the ICMP packet
`sniffer_1.py`

#### Capture any TCP packet that comes from a particular IP and with a destination port number 23.
`sniffer_2.py`

#### Capture packets that come from or go to a particular subnet. You should not pick the subnet that your VM is attached to.
`sniffer_3.py`

#### Spoofing ICMP Packets
`spoof_1.py`

#### Traceroute
`traceroute.py`

#### Sniffing and then Spoofing
`sniff_spoof.py`
